why we didnt declare WebDriver and Properties as static variable in our base class?
so they can be global and we can use them through out our prog?

Don't we need to extend baseclass in both login and loginscanario classes?

what is public static ThreadLocal<WebDriver> tldriver = new ThreadLocal<WebDriver>();?

After login we entered in Dashbored page...Now i want to click on Assign Leave button..
I put AssignLeave button in dashboared page.Now i need to make dashBoaredScanario ...
will i call asignLeavebutton in  dashbored scanario ?

in AssignLeave page how I use Explicit wait utility for Leavetype dropdown and calender date? 

//where will you initialize ur page factory?in login class or login Scanario class ?its not a good practice to initialize 
pagefactory in login class where we are defining our object repository?
In your pom.xml file remove the scope and this should work fine.

As per below code in pom.xml, remove the scope tag.
<dependency>
            <groupId>org.testng</groupId>
            <artifactId>testng</artifactId>
            <version>6.8.7</version>
            **<scope>test</scope>** //Remove this line and compile maven
</dependency>
Even though we have imported the maven dependency for Testng, when you add scope tag in XML file, it treats as JUnit annotation and not as Testng. So when I removed scope tag, My @Test Annotation was treated as Testng Annotation.
